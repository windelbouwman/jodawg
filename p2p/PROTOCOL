Phonebook
---------
The phonebook is a structure which contains for each USER ID 
the associated NODE addresses and the status of each NODE. It
may also contain other meta-data about a USER.
USER_ID: (NODE_A, NODE_A_STATUS) (NODE_B, NODE_B_STATUS) ...

When a user logges in, the facilitating NODE changes it's
phonebook and propagates the change to N of the nodes with
the highest uptime it knows. They in turn do the same thing,
but avoid message duplication.

When a new user logs in to the network, it copies the phonebook
of the NODE that facilitated the login process.

If a user can not find a USER_ID in it's own phonebook it
contacts the n NODES with the highest uptimes and queries
them.

Stability Points
----------------
When a NODE joins the network it's stability is 0. Every N minutes
the node is polled by other M other NODES, if these nodes all
find that the NODE is reachable (and responsive) they increase
their stability rating for the NODE.

NODE's themselves only keep stability ratings on OTHER nodes,
never on themselves.

The actual stability of a NODE is the average stability rating
of that NODE at all the NODES that have queried it.

The polling interval should decrease as the stability rating
increases.
